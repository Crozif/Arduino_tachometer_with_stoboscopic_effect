# Arduino_tachometer_with_stoboscopic_effect

The purpose of this tool is to measure any rotation speed with the same accuracy as a commercial product,
it can also blink at afrequency defined by the user to match the roatation of anything up to 1Khz.

It can be powered with usb (5V) or with a 12V power supply, when it's connected to 12V the tachometer can output 12V (20A max) at the blinking frequency. 
Since my workshop has a 12V power line to feed my LED lights and tools this allow me to blink all my lights simultaneously to analyze the rotation of any tool.

The left gift show my spindle's CNC at 12 000rpm with the matching frequency. The other gift show the same setup with a slightly different blinking frequency.
